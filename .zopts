setopt no_beep # don't beep on error
setopt interactive_comments # Allow comments even in interactive shells (especially for Muness)

# ===== Changing Directories
setopt auto_cd # If you type foo, and it isn't a command, and it is a directory in your cdpath, go there
setopt cdablevarS # if argument to cd is the name of a parameter whose value is a valid directory, it will become the current directory
setopt pushd_ignore_dups # don't push multiple copies of the same directory onto the directory stack

# ===== Expansion and Globbing
setopt extended_glob # treat #, ~, and ^ as part of patterns for filename generation

# ===== History
setopt append_history # Allow multiple terminal sessions to all append to one zsh command history
setopt extended_history # save timestamp of command and duration
setopt inc_append_history # Add comamnds as they are typed, don't wait until shell exit
setopt hist_expire_dups_first # when trimming history, lose oldest duplicates first
setopt hist_ignore_dups # Do not write events to history that are duplicates of previous events
setopt hist_ignore_all_dups # Remove older duplicate entries from history
setopt hist_ignore_space # remove command line from history list when first character on the line is a space
setopt hist_find_no_dups # When searching history don't display results already cycled through twice
setopt hist_reduce_blanks # Remove extra blanks from each command line being added to history
setopt hist_verify # don't execute, just expand history
setopt share_history # imports new commands and appends typed commands to history

# ===== Completion
setopt always_to_end # When completing from the middle of a word, move the cursor to the end of the word
setopt auto_menu # show completion menu on successive tab press. needs unsetop menu_complete to work
setopt auto_name_dirs # any parameter that is set to the absolute name of a directory immediately becomes a name for that directory
setopt complete_in_word # Allow completion from within a word/phrase

unsetopt menu_complete # do not autoselect the first completion entry

# ===== Correction
unsetopt correct_all # spelling correction for arguments
setopt correct # spelling correction for commands

# ===== Prompt
setopt prompt_subst # Enable parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion in the prompt
# setopt transient_rprompt # only show the rprompt on the current prompt

# ===== Scripts and Functions
setopt multios # perform implicit tees or cats when multiple redirections are attempted

# why would you type 'cd dir' if you could just type 'dir'?
setopt AUTO_CD

# Now we can pipe to multiple outputs!
setopt MULTIOS

# This makes cd=pushd
setopt AUTO_PUSHD

# This will use named dirs when possible
setopt AUTO_NAME_DIRS

# If we have a glob this will expand it
setopt GLOB_COMPLETE
setopt PUSHD_MINUS

# No more annoying pushd messages...
# setopt PUSHD_SILENT

# blank pushd goes to home
setopt PUSHD_TO_HOME

# this will ignore multiple directories for the stack.  Useful?  I dunno.
setopt PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS

# 10 second wait if you do something that will delete everything.  I wish I'd had this before...
setopt RM_STAR_WAIT

setopt NO_HUP

setopt IGNORE_EOF

# If I could disable Ctrl-s completely I would!
setopt NO_FLOW_CONTROL

# Keep echo "station" > station from clobbering station
# setopt NO_CLOBBER

# Case insensitive globbing
setopt NO_CASE_GLOB

# Be Reasonable!
setopt NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT

# I don't know why I never set this before.
setopt EXTENDED_GLOB

# hows about arrays be awesome?  (that is, frew${cool}frew has frew surrounding all the variables, not just first and last
setopt RC_EXPAND_PARAM
